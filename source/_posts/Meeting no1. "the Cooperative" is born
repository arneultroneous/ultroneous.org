###Hello friends of freedom and all you lovely people who read this.

We have a reason to celebrate.

On Saturday, 9th of September, "The Cooperative" was found.

The first meeting happened and we created a base from where we will connect the world of free people.

We proudly present and share what happened so far.

So: On Saturday (9th September 2017) we came together in [Tamera](https://www.tamera.org/index.html)
The first thing to happend was to get to know each other more so we shared parts of our individual lifestory.
Out of this we gained insides on why all of us sat together on one table with the same dream: changing the world,
liberating the lost and scattered recourses and picking up the shards of the future to rebuild a wonderful mandala.

After we approved that it was indeed good to meet, we went into a planning process.
Here is the result of it.

First, in order to remind what the cooperative would be about and put again consiousness to our mission, 
we read the article [A Cooperative](http://ultroneous.org/article/2017/08/19/cooperative.html).
We agreed that the "unbusiness" is our agenda.

Afterwards we decided on "One Minute Goals" for each and all of us to be accomplished within
the following week to give the first push to this perpetuum mobile.

These "One Minute Goals" where kept as such:

1-Establish performance metric
-Research into map of consciousness(developed by Awkins)
-Read A city is not a tree(Christofer Alexander) - Dio Arne
-Read 5s method on Wikipedia - Dio Arne
-Write list of patterns- next saturday
-Evaluate them- next saturday

2-Establish stake holder managements
-Make list of contacts- Dio Arne
-Design offers and requests- next saturday/sunday
-Design path of involvement(knownq, interested, engaged, committed)- 
next saturday/sunday

3-Design and define online documentation- Arne

4-Establish treasury- Next saturday
-Create common Cryptocurrency Wallet
-Establish decision making structure
-Make a structure that doesnʼt get on our way when in full trust or doesnʼt 
break down when in full fear

5-Build Mining Rig- Dio, expected by next full moon
-Research
-Order
-Setup

6-Read one minute manager- Dio Arne

After defining and approving these goals, the next step was to define ourselves a bit more.
No questions asked we like to define ourselves in staying undefined, means: everything is always changable.
Like this we can act on a solid foundation while staying fluent like beautyful water.

So let's see what's the result of these first undefined definitions.

#####A cooperative that needs a name

The primary driver is we are leaving in a world where global systems and 
cultures are collapsing. The streams of lost power in the form of displaced 
people, abandoned places, wasted material and scatter knowledge need to be 
gathered again.

And the cooperative has one team, Spencer, Diogo, Arne.

#####_Spencer_-The Organiser, contribute container leadership as defined in the 
changed leadership framework*
The time commitment is Saturday morning until Sunday evening every week.
Take responsibility where the cooperative would take responsibility for where 
its not clear where another roll would take responsibility for.

#####_Diogo_-Technician, responsible for finding ways to do things that the 
cooperative doesnʼt know how to do yet.
Expect to be available to receive tasks 24/7.
Expect to complete one huge complex task per month.

The networker, practice stake holder management, making offers and requests 
to build connections and cooperation.
Seeing  a lot of potential in resources like abandoned places, create a meeting 
point for people, manage and gather resources.

#####_Arne-_ Student , actively search for the highest possible value that you can 
contribute to the cooperative, ask how this can  happen. Stay in high awareness 
of tension, confusion, doubts in your self and others, flaws in the cooperative 
and always relentlessly ask questions.
Always have a clear learning task.

Dedicate Wendsay and Thursday each week to learning and working for the 
cooperative.

After this we agreed to sleep and meet again on the next day.

Sunday morning we came together and went to Matinee at [Tamera](https://www.tamera.org/index.html),
followed by a delicious brunch with inrcedibly tasty vegan food.

Afterwards,still in full comittment and motivation, we started going into the matter of "the Cooperative" again so we ageed to 
search fo a quiet place to talk more about how we want to proceed further with this unbusiness.

In this "half meeting" we decided on the following:

We agreed to keep the website on github.com for now.

Also we decided, that each member of the Cooperative has a weekly budget of 0.15 BTC (Cryptocurrency) for expenses that support
the cooperative. These expenses will be documented with date, amount, currancy, from, to and with describtion what it is used for.

We want to state,that this decision was not easy to take scince we are talking about money and these things need to be dicussed 
very carefully and with high awareness.
In order to not close our "half meeting" with such a high intesity feeling, we took a last very light decision on which
online platform would be used as a communcation cloud.

We agreed for it to be github as a temporary solution.

We will keep this documentation of progress up so you will be able  to see what is and will happen.

Thank you for being you and in love we are looking forward to our next post.

"The Cooperative"
